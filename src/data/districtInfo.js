Farmers engage in a meticulous process beginning with land preparation, which involves plowing and leveling to ensure suitable soil conditions for planting. Pigeonpea seeds, selected based on local climate and soil suitability, are sown at the onset of the monsoon, typically between June and July. Due to the reliance on rainfed agriculture, proper water management becomes crucial, with farmers closely monitoring rainfall patterns to supplement irrigation as needed. Throughout the growth cycle, farmers employ practices such as weeding and pest control to ensure optimal crop health and yield. Pigeonpea is harvested post-monsoon, generally between September and October, using traditional methods or modern machinery, depending on farm scale and accessibility. Post-harvest, proper storage and processing techniques are employed to maintain grain quality. Given the region's dependence on rainfed agriculture, variations in rainfall patterns can significantly impact pigeonpea yields, necessitating adaptive farming strategies and resilience against climatic uncertainties.",

The crop undergoes vegetative growth during the winter months and matures by March to April, followed by harvest. Rainfed wheat cultivation involves adapting to local agro-climatic conditions and traditional agronomic practices to optimize yields while managing risks associated with rainfall variability.",
