Farmers rely on the natural rainfall pattern for irrigation, with sowing typically commencing with the onset of monsoon rains, usually between June and July. The crop matures by October to November, with harvests following thereafter. The rainfed cultivation of rice involves adapting to local agro-climatic conditions and traditional agronomic practices to optimize yields.",

Farmers utilize irrigation infrastructure, including canals, tube wells, or other water sources, to supplement water requirements during the growing period. This allows for more controlled water management, enabling farmers to mitigate the risks associated with rainfall variability. Similar to rainfed cultivation, irrigated rice cultivation involves selecting appropriate rice varieties and employing suitable agronomic practices to achieve optimal yields.",
